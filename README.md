This project explores historical data surrounding one of the world's most prestigious awards. It involves analyzing and visualizing data on Nobel Prize laureates across different categories, years, and demographics. This project combines data manipulation with meaningful visualization tasks using an interesting and manageable dataset.

The project uses various visualization techniques while engaging with real-world data that has cultural and historical significance. It also introduces the important concept of using data visualization to uncover and communicate potential biases, teaching critical thinking alongside technical skills.

Key data visualization skills used in this project are:

Creating time series visualizations to show trends over decades
Designing bar charts and pie charts for categorical data (e.g., prize categories)
Developing heat maps or choropleth maps for geographical analysis
Using color effectively to represent different categories or highlight disparities
